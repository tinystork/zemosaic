# ZeMosaic Qt Port — Follow-up & Checklist

This file tracks the progress of the PySide6 (Qt) GUI migration and related tasks.

- Before each coding session, the agent MUST:
  - Read this file.
  - Identify the next unchecked item.
  - Work only on that item (or that small coherent group), unless otherwise instructed.
- After each session, update the checkboxes and notes.
- Never mark a task as completed if the implementation has not been verified.

---

## Phase 1 — Qt skeleton and guarded imports

**Goal:** Get minimal Qt files and a backend selector in place, without changing existing behavior.

- [x] Create `zemosaic_gui_qt.py` with minimal QMainWindow and run_qt_main
- [x] Create `zemosaic_filter_gui_qt.py` with stub launch_filter_interface_qt
- [x] Add backend selector in `run_zemosaic.py`
- [x] Guard all PySide6 imports (try/except ImportError)


## Phase 2 — Basic Qt Main Window structure

- [x] Create Qt layout placeholders (folders, ASTAP, mosaic, crop/quality, log/progress)
- [x] Add Start/Stop placeholders
- [x] Load config in Qt UI
- [x] Load localization in Qt UI


## Phase 3 — Layout and widgets mirroring Tk GUI

### 3.1 Folders and basic paths
- [x] Input folder controls
- [x] Output folder controls

### 3.2 ASTAP configuration
- [x] ASTAP executable path widget
- [x] ASTAP data directory widget
- [x] Downsample / sensitivity / radius widgets

### 3.3 Mosaic / clustering parameters
- [x] Cluster threshold
- [x] Target master tiles
- [x] Orientation split degrees

### 3.4 Cropping / quality / Alt-Az
- [x] Quality crop settings
- [x] Alt-Az cleanup widgets
- [x] ZeQualityMT toggles
- [x] Two-pass coverage renorm toggles

### 3.5 Logging / progress panel
- [x] Qt log area
- [x] Qt progress bar
- [x] Phase / ETA / elapsed labels

---

## Phase 4 — Worker integration and threading

- [x] Qt worker wrapper using QThread or queue polling
- [x] Progress, phase, and log message signals
- [x] Qt Start button launching worker
- [x] Qt Stop/Abort button stopping worker
- [x] Proper thread cleanup


## Phase 5 — Qt Filter GUI

- [x] Qt filter dialog skeleton
- [x] Table/list of files
- [x] Matplotlib preview via FigureCanvasQTAgg
- [x] Stream scan mode
- [x] Clustering / grouping controls
- [x] ASTAP scanning
- [x] Return (filtered_list, accepted, overrides)


## Phase 6 — Polishing and parity with Tk

- [x] Ensure all Tk options exist in Qt
- [x] Verify config read/write consistency
- [x] Full localization
- [x] Add docstrings and comments
- [x] Tk remains the default backend

# 🔵 POST-PORTAGE AUDIT TASKS  
Tasks derived from the audit performed after Phase 6 completion.

These MUST now be completed in the order shown below.

---

## Task A — GPU Configuration Parity

**Goal:**  
When the user toggles GPU acceleration in the Qt GUI, the following legacy keys MUST also be updated for backward compatibility:

- `stack_use_gpu`
- `use_gpu_stack`

This ensures that tools and worker components expecting Tk-style GPU config remain consistent when using the Qt GUI.

**Detailed requirements:**

- [x] Update Qt GPU toggle handler to write both new-style and legacy-style GPU config keys.
- [x] Ensure config snapshots match those produced by Tk GUI.
- [ ] Ensure switching backend (Qt ↔ Tk) does not change stacked GPU behavior.
- [ ] Add notes in followup.md once implemented.


---

## Task B — GPU Helper / ETA Parity

**Goal:**  
Qt GUI must process GPU-helper events the same way Tk GUI does.

The worker emits special payloads including:

- `global_coadd_info_helper_path`
- GPU ETA override messages
- GPU warnings
- GPU-progress metadata

Qt currently treats these as plain log lines. Tk extracts and displays:

- ETA overlays  
- warnings  
- helper info  
- GPU-progress UI feedback  

**Detailed requirements:**

- [ ] Extend Qt `_handle_payload` to detect the same event types as Tk.
- [ ] Implement Qt-safe equivalents of `_handle_gpu_helper_*`.
- [ ] Update Qt UI labels / overlays accordingly.
- [ ] Ensure no business logic duplication; reuse worker payloads.


---

## Task C — Enforce Strict followup.md Updating

**Goal:**  
Ensure the coding agent ALWAYS updates this file after completing a task.

**Detailed requirements:**

- [ ] Add code comments or agent instructions where needed so the next coding actions always:
  - Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
  - Add notes or caveats
- [ ] Ensure this behavior is enforced in subsequent runs.


---

## Notes / Known Issues

(Add here any clarifications or partial work notes related to tasks A/B/C)

- [x] Qt config serialization now normalizes legacy GPU keys to match Tk snapshots.
- [ ]
